# AI BOOTCAMP GROUP PROJECT (Project 1)
This repository shares the source data, examination approach, data analytics script and key findings of an examination of the impacts of extreme weather and climate events on public health and local economy, with a particular emphasis on extreme heat and impacts to North Carolina 

## Executive Summary
The three-person project team sought to examine the relationship between extreme weather and climate events across public health, agriculture, labor and other economically significant indicators.

## Summary Findings
_[ADD SUMMARY FINDINGS HERE]_

### Evaluation Approach
The team sought to identify patterns, trends relationships through the evaluation of extreme weather and climate events, event-related health impacts, and the agricultural productivity and commerce trends for impacted states as well as any resulting energy system and water constraints. 
 
 The team explored datasets published by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), NC Department of Commerce, NC Utilities Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
